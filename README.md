# Fintech Alignment — Automation, Security, and Compliance

> A focused case study connecting my fintech operations, automation, and compliance work to typical product and G&A needs at high-growth financial-technology companies.

## 🏗 About This Project
Fintech teams operate across payments, invoicing, collections, and sensitive PII/PCI data flows. This mini-repo outlines how I apply secure-by-default practices and automation to enable small, fast teams without sacrificing controls.

## 🔑 Themes
- **Fintech DNA:** Led IT, security operations, and PCI DSS 4.0.1 certification at a payments company (policy authoring, evidence automation, auditor interface).
- **Automation Culture:** Built HR/SaaS provisioning, ticket intake, and documentation pipelines that scale without headcount.
- **Compliance as a Feature:** Established quarterly evidence runs and a living control matrix that map to PCI DSS and SOC 2.

## 🛠 First 90 Days (Example Plan)
1. **Assess & Stabilize:** inventory systems, map data flows (payments, PII), review CA policies, SLAs, and incident runbooks
2. **Automate the Basics:** HR onboarding/offboarding, Slack→Jira intake, KB refresh with Confluence
3. **Compliance Backbone:** quarterly evidence runs, PCI→SOC 2 mapping, living control matrix
4. **Ops Metrics:** weekly dashboards (SLA, endpoint health, auth anomalies, change volume)

## 📊 KPIs
- Time-to-ready for new hires
- SLA adherence + MTTR
- Audit prep time and re-request rate
- Auth anomalies per 1k users (downward trend)

## 🤖 AI in Practice
- **ChatGPT Pro:** summarize audit logs and change tickets into auditor-friendly narratives
- **Claude:** rewrite SOPs in plain English; generate user-facing KB drafts
- **Gemini:** quick control-mapping checks and cross-references

## 📎 Artifacts Included
- Sample quarterly evidence plan
- Control matrix snippet (PCI→SOC 2)
- Onboarding checklist + Jira workflow diagram (redacted)

## 🗣️ Positioning — One-Liner
> *“Fintech focus, automation-first, and compliance-ready operations — with measurable SLA and audit outcomes.”*
